# Final-year-Project
The "Music Generation & Recommendation Using Emotion Detection" project aims to create an innovative music recommendation that leverages emotion detection technology and generation system that generates new pieces of music everytime. This project integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance the user's music listening experience by providing personalized music recommendations that matches their emotional state and generating music .
The focus of this bachelor thesis is also to generate appealing music segments algorithmically.Since its creation, the art of music has constantly evolved, developing new genres and styles over time. Computers have long been recognized for their potential in discovering new music, but a computer has yet to produce a truly appealing piece of music. In this paper, a genetic algorithm for making music compositions is presented. Position based representation of rhythm and relative representation of pitches, based on measuring relation from starting pitch, allow for a flexible and robust way for encoding music compositions. The created music would be diverse, original and could in many cases be considered to be appealing.
